# Simple Calculator

Java application, based on Spring Boot, that receives new calculations via REST.
It saves the formula and the result in an in-memory database.
The application can return the list of calculations via a REST GET call.

## Run the application

Within an IDE, you can run the Spring Boot application.
Alternatively, you can build the application yourself by running mvn clean install.
A jar file is then created in the target folder.
